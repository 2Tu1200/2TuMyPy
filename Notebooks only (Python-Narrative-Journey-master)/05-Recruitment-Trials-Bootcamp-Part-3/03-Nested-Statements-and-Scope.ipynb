    "# Nested Statements and Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back recruit. After those Function Tasks you should now be a lot more comfortable writing functions. Later on we will see how functions can interact with each other as part of larger scripts, in order to continue this discussion, we need to learn about nested statements and scope. Its important to understand how Python deals with the variable and function names you assign. When you create a variable name in Python the name is stored in a name-space. Variable names also have a scope, the scope determines the visibility of that variable name to other parts of your code.\n",
