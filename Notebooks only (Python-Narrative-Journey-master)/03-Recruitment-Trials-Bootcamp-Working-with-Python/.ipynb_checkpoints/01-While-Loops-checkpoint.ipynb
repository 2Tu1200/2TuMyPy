    "Be careful with while loops! There is a potential to write a condition that always remains True, meaning you have an infinite running while loop. If this happens to you, try using Ctrl+C to kill the loop. Often in a notebook setting that won't work, so you can try to restart the kernel. If that still doesn't work, use Ctrl+C at the command line running the notebook. Still not working recruit? Oh boy, you're in trouble now! Try restarting your computer :)\n",
