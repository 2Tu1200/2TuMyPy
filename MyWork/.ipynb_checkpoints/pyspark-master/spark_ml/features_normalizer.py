"""
Normalizer is a Transformer which transforms a dataset of Vector rows, 
normalizing each Vector to have unit norm. It takes parameter p, which 
specifies the p-norm used for normalization. (p=2 by default.) 

This normalization can help standardize your input data and improve the 
behavior of learning algorithms.
